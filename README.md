# The role of insularity: plants have few ornithophilous traits but are visited by morphologically more distinct hummingbirds in the Caribbean islands.

This is a extensive dataset of floral traits covering a vast biogeographical gradient. Records range from southern Brazil to the Central USA and the Caribbean islands.
There are 1275 plant species, of which 1030 are fully identified with current, accepted names.
Traits are corolla length (mm), nectar concentration (%) and floral color (categorical).

In this study, we explore how floral traits of hummingbird-visited plants are distributed across three biogeographical regions of mainland America (Lowland South America, Andes, Central & North America) and the Caribbean islands. Islands are typically depauperated in their species communities and they often have unstable environmental conditions - in the Caribbean islands, for example, hurricanes frequently lead to severe damages with dramatic impacts on communities. We thus expected plant communities in the Caribbean islands to display proportionally fewer floral traits that would indicate a specialization towards hummingbird visitation. Specifically we expected to find on average shorter corollas, higher nectar concentrations and proportionally fewer red/orange colors in the floral displays.
